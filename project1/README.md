# Project 1: Embarrassingly Parallel Programming

## Deatils may be modified later before official release

# Topic: Image Processing

## Problem Description

Details to be released on Week 3

### Implementations of Six Parallel Programming Languages Are Required

- Vectorization/SIMD
- MPI (Message Passing Interface)
- Pthread
- OpenMP
- CUDA
- OpenACC

### Grading Scheme

- Implementation (90%)
  You can get full mark in this part if you implemented everything and get expected speedup as the sample solutions
  provided by the TA.
- Report (10%)\
  No need to spend too much time writing a very beautiful report.
- Extra Credits\
  If you can use any other methods to achieve a higher speedup than the sample solutions provided by the TA

**Notes**: Unlike the previous semesters, the extra credits cannot be added to other programming projects.
The usage of extra credits is to raise your grade to a higher level if your grade is around the boundary of two levels.
For example, if you are the first place among B+ students, extra credits may help you raise to A-.
Please refer to the professor for more details.

## Project Organization

### Part-A: Sample solution codes of a simple image processing problem

Students are provided the executable sample codes of all six programming languages. This part requires students to get
used to the cluster platform, compiling, building and executing the sample programs by themselves.
After this, students should have an overview about how these programming languages work (although they may not
understand much of the implementation details), and have an intuitive experience on speeding up computation with various
parallel programming techniques.

### Part-B: A little modification on Part-A codes for another image processing problem

Students need to do some minor modifications on the source codes given in Part-A for another image processing problem.
After the implementation, students should write a brief report about what they have done, parallel speedup, and maybe
what they have learned from this project.
