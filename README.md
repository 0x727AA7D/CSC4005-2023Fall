# CSC4005/MDS6108 Parallel Programming 2023-24Fall

## Prologue

Welcome to take course **CSC4005/MDS6108: Parallel Programming** offered by The Chinese University of HongKong, Shenzhen. In
this semester, you will learn the basic principal and philosophy of parallel programming, including embarrassingly
parallelism, reduction, synchronization, load balancing and so on. After taking this course, you should be familiar with
some parallel programming languages, and be able to use them to design efficient parallel
programs.

## Parallel Programming Languages Used in This Course

- Vectorization/SIMD
- MPI (Message Passing Interface)
